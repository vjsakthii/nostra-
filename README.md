# 🚀 Project Showcase: Nostra - Clothing E-commerce Website Clone 🚀

Excited to share that I successfully cloned a clothing shopping website called Nostra using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript! 🛍️💻

Through this project, I explored:
✨ Responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS
✨ Dynamic interactivity using JavaScript
✨ Real-world e-commerce layouts and user experience flows

Building real-world application clones has helped me sharpen my frontend skills, improve my problem-solving mindset, and get one step closer to becoming a better developer. 🚀
Every project is a learning experience — and I’m excited for what’s ahead! 🌟
